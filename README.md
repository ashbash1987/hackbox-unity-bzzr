# Hackbox Unity BZZR

A sample Unity project that uses [Hackbox Unity](https://github.com/ashbash1987/hackbox-unity) to implement buzzers similarly to a previous buzzer system, [BZZR Unity](https://github.com/ashbash1987/bzzr-unity).

Project uses Unity 2020.3.30f1, though the code in the project should be mostly supported in any Unity version from 2019.3 onwards.
